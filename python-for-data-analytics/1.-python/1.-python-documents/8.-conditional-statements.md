# 8. Conditional Statements

**What are Conditional Statements?**

We have often used conditional statements in our daily life, such as :

**if** _it rains_ ,i will go to office.

**Syntax:**

In \[ ]:

```
if expression:  
    statement  
```

<figure><img src="https://2715416193-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FqrOwR7E0344TGTnSFHoL%2Fuploads%2Fk7vQ1SkZnfI3Ae0GP4uZ%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=4684f90c-475c-4e65-a38f-64b728e987b7" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Above Figure Shows , Actions or decisions based on the Condition. If the condition is True, i will not go to office. Here are some Examples for if statement:

**How to Find if a number is even?**

In \[2]:

```
number = int(input("Enter the number:"))

if(number%2==0):
    print(f'{number} is an even number')
    print(f'{number} is not an odd number')

print("Program ended")
```

```
Enter the number:10
10 is an even number
10 is not an odd number
Program ended
```

### Indentation:

Python indentation is a way of telling python intrepreter that the group of statements/code/instrtuctions belong to a particular block.

In more simpler terms , indentation is nothing but a bunch of spaces or tabs signifying a particular line of code belongs to a same group.

Now You saw what will happen if the condition is true in above case. All the code with same indentation will run. But what will happen if the condition is False?

In \[3]:

```
number = int(input("Enter the number:"))

if(number%2==0):
    print(f'{number} is an even number')
    print(f'{number} is not an odd number')

print("Program ended")
```

```
Enter the number:15
Program ended
```

So, Here the codes with same indentation did not run, it shows that if condition is True, Body of if will run. Body of if (Codes written under if statement by using indentation.), if Condition is False, Body of if will not run.

**Note:**&#x57;e generally use Tab to define indentations. One Tab means 4 spaces.

### if-else statement:

The if-else statement is similar to if statement except the fact that, it also provides the block of the code for the false case of the condition to be checked.

If the condition provided in the if statement is false, then the else statement will be executed.

For Example : . **if** coffee house is open i'll go there **else** i will be at home.

In \[ ]:

```
if condition:  
    #block of statements   
else:   
    #another block of statements (else-block)  
```

**To find if a number is even or odd:**

In \[2]:

```
number = int(input("Enter the number:"))

if(number%2==0):
    print(f'{number} is an even number')
else:
    print(f'{number} is an odd number')
```

```
Enter the number:10
10 is an even number
```

In \[3]:

```
number = int(input("Enter the number:"))

if(number%2==0):
    print(f'{number} is an even number')
else:
    print(f'{number} is an odd number')
```

```
Enter the number:15
15 is an odd number
```

### if-elif statement:

The elif statement enables us to check multiple conditions and execute the specific block of statements depending upon what condition is True.

**Syntax:**

In \[ ]:

```
if expression 1:   
    # block of statements   
  
elif expression 2:   
    # block of statements   
  
elif expression 3:   
    # block of statements   
  
else:   
    # block of statements 
```

So , elif - statement , in more simpler terms runs body of first if or elif statement with true condition and if any of the condition is not true , body of else executes.

For Example:

**Program to find grade of a student based on marks:**

In \[1]:

```
marks = int(input("Please enter the marks:")) 

if(marks>90):
    grade = "A"
elif(marks>70):
    grade="B"
elif(marks>50):
    grade = "C"
elif(marks>30):
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

print(f"your grade : {grade}")
```

```
Please enter the marks:40
your grade : D
```

### Nested if:

There may be a situation when you want to check for another condition after a condition resolves to true. In such a situation, you can use the nested if construct.

In more simpler terms, Nested if is actually if statement under an if statement.

**Syntax:**

In \[ ]:

```
if expression 1:   
    # block of statements   
  
    if expression 2:   
        # block of statements   
  
        if expression 3:   
            # block of statements   
```

**Program to find Largest Number among three numbers:**

In \[1]:

```
a = int(input("enter the number:"))
b = int(input("enter the number:"))
c = int(input("enter the number:"))

if(a>b):
    if(a>c):
        large = a
    else:
        large = c
else:
    if(b>c):
        large = b
    else:
        large = c

print("Largest Number is: ", c)
```

```
enter the number:5
enter the number:10
enter the number:15
Largest Number is:  15
```

**Note:**&#x52;un above code in your editor and change values to see , how this code is working.

## Branching using Conditional Statements and Loops in Python

<figure><img src="https://2715416193-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FqrOwR7E0344TGTnSFHoL%2Fuploads%2FEVHDoY6GNcLJXc9qC6Sp%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=1108c8bc-3862-4966-ae30-c9ff7b61051d" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This tutorial covers the following topics:

* Branching with `if`, `else` and `elif`
* Nested conditions and `if` expressions
* Iteration with `while` loops
* Iterating over containers with `for` loops
* Nested loops, `break` and `continue` statements

#### Branching with `if`, `else` and `elif`

One of the most powerful features of programming languages is _branching_: the ability to make decisions and execute a different set of statements based on whether one or more conditions are true.

**The `if` statement**

In Python, branching is implemented using the `if` statement, which is written as follows:

```
if condition:
    statement1
    statement2
```

The `condition` can be a value, variable or expression. If the condition evaluates to `True`, then the statements within the _`if` block_ are executed. Notice the four spaces before `statement1`, `statement2`, etc. The spaces inform Python that these statements are associated with the `if` statement above. This technique of structuring code by adding spaces is called _indentation_.

> **Indentation**: Python relies heavily on _indentation_ (white space before a statement) to define code structure. This makes Python code easy to read and understand. You can run into problems if you don't use indentation properly. Indent your code by placing the cursor at the start of the line and pressing the `Tab` key once to add 4 spaces. Pressing `Tab` again will indent the code further by 4 more spaces, and press `Shift+Tab` will reduce the indentation by 4 spaces.

For example, let's write some code to check and print a message if a given number is even.

```
a_number = 34
```

```
if a_number % 2 == 0:
    print("We're inside an if block")
    print(f'The given number {a_number} is even.')
```

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-e8e68e9c1a14> in <module>
----> 1 if a_number % 2 == 0:
      2     print("We're inside an if block")
      3     print(f'The given number {a_number} is even.')

NameError: name 'a_number' is not defined
```

We use the modulus operator `%` to calculate the remainder from the division of `a_number` by `2`. Then, we use the comparison operator `==` check if the remainder is `0`, which tells us whether the number is even, i.e., divisible by 2.

Since `34` is divisible by `2`, the expression `a_number % 2 == 0` evaluates to `True`, so the `print` statement under the `if` statement is executed. Also, note that we are using the string `format` method to include the number within the message.

Let's try the above again with an odd number.

```
another_number = 33
```

In \[4]:

```
if another_number % 2 == 0:
    print(f'The given number {a_number} is even.')
```

As expected, since the condition `another_number % 2 == 0` evaluates to `False`, no message is printed.

**The `else` statement**

We may want to print a different message if the number is not even in the above example. This can be done by adding the `else` statement. It is written as follows:

```
if condition:
    statement1
    statement2
else:
    statement4
    statement5
```

If `condition` evaluates to `True`, the statements in the `if` block are executed. If it evaluates to `False`, the statements in the `else` block are executed.

In \[5]:

```
a_number = 34
```

In \[6]:

```
if a_number % 2 == 0:
    print(f'The given number {a_number} is even.')
else:
    print(f'The given number {a_number} is odd.')
```

```
The given number 34 is even.
```

In \[7]:

```
another_number = 33
```

In \[8]:

```
if another_number % 2 == 0:
    print(f'The given number {another_number} is even.')
else:
    print(f'The given number {another_number} is odd.')
```

```
The given number 33 is odd.
```

Here's another example, which uses the `in` operator to check membership within a tuple.

In \[9]:

```
the_3_musketeers = ('Athos', 'Porthos', 'Aramis')
```

In \[10]:

```
a_candidate = "D'Artagnan"
```

In \[11]:

```
if a_candidate in the_3_musketeers:
    print(f"{a_candidate} is a musketeer")
else:
    print(f"{a_candidate} is not a musketeer")
```

```
D'Artagnan is not a musketeer
```

**The `elif` statement**

Python also provides an `elif` statement (short for "else if") to chain a series of conditional blocks. The conditions are evaluated one by one. For the first condition that evaluates to `True`, the block of statements below it is executed. The remaining conditions and statements are not evaluated. So, in an `if`, `elif`, `elif`... chain, at most one block of statements is executed, the one corresponding to the first condition that evaluates to `True`.

In \[12]:

```
today = 'Wednesday'
```

In \[13]:

```
if today == 'Sunday':
    print("Today is the day of the sun.")
elif today == 'Monday':
    print("Today is the day of the moon.")
elif today == 'Tuesday':
    print("Today is the day of Tyr, the god of war.")
elif today == 'Wednesday':
    print("Today is the day of Odin, the supreme diety.")
elif today == 'Thursday':
    print("Today is the day of Thor, the god of thunder.")
elif today == 'Friday':
    print("Today is the day of Frigga, the goddess of beauty.")
elif today == 'Saturday':
    print("Today is the day of Saturn, the god of fun and feasting.")
```

```
Today is the day of Odin, the supreme diety.
```

In the above example, the first 3 conditions evaluate to `False`, so none of the first 3 messages are printed. The fourth condition evaluates to `True`, so the corresponding message is printed. The remaining conditions are skipped. Try changing the value of `today` above and re-executing the cells to print all the different messages.

To verify that the remaining conditions are skipped, let us try another example.

In \[14]:

```
a_number = 15
```

```
if a_number % 2 == 0:
    print(f'{a_number} is divisible by 2')
elif a_number % 3 == 0:
    print(f'{a_number} is divisible by 3')
elif a_number % 5 == 0:
    print(f'{a_number} is divisible by 5')
elif a_number % 7 == 0:
    print(f'{a_number} is divisible by 7')
```

```
15 is divisible by 3
```

Note that the message `15 is divisible by 5` is not printed because the condition `a_number % 5 == 0` isn't evaluated, since the previous condition `a_number % 3 == 0` evaluates to `True`. This is the key difference between using a chain of `if`, `elif`, `elif`... statements vs. a chain of `if` statements, where each condition is evaluated independently.

In \[16]:

```
if a_number % 2 == 0:
    print(f'{a_number} is divisible by 2')
if a_number % 3 == 0:
    print(f'{a_number} is divisible by 3')
if a_number % 5 == 0:
    print(f'{a_number} is divisible by 5')
if a_number % 7 == 0:
    print(f'{a_number} is divisible by 7')
```

```
15 is divisible by 3
15 is divisible by 5
```

**Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` together**

You can also include an `else` statement at the end of a chain of `if`, `elif`... statements. This code within the `else` block is evaluated when none of the conditions hold true.

In \[17]:

```
a_number = 49
```

```
if a_number % 2 == 0:
    print(f'{a_number} is divisible by 2')
elif a_number % 3 == 0:
    print(f'{a_number} is divisible by 3')
elif a_number % 5 == 0:
    print(f'{a_number} is divisible by 5')
else:
    print('All checks failed!')
    print(f'{a_number} is not divisible by 2, 3 or 5')
```

```
All checks failed!
49 is not divisible by 2, 3 or 5
```

In \[19]:

```
a_number = 12
```

In \[20]:

```
if a_number % 3 == 0 and a_number % 5 == 0:
    print(f"The number {a_number} is divisible by 3 and 5")
elif not a_number % 5 == 0:
    print(f"The number {a_number} is not divisible by 5")
```

```
The number 12 is not divisible by 5
```

**Non-Boolean Conditions**

Note that conditions do not necessarily have to be booleans. In fact, a condition can be any value. The value is converted into a boolean automatically using the `bool` operator. This means that falsy values like `0`, `''`, `{}`, `[]`, etc. evaluate to `False` and all other values evaluate to `True`.

In \[21]:

```
if '':
    print('The condition evaluted to True')
else:
    print('The condition evaluted to False')
```

```
The condition evaluted to False
```

In \[22]:

```
if 'Hello':
    print('The condition evaluted to True')
else:
    print('The condition evaluted to False')
```

```
The condition evaluted to True
```

In \[23]:

```
if { 'a': 34 }:
    print('The condition evaluted to True')
else:
    print('The condition evaluted to False')
```

```
The condition evaluted to True
```

In \[24]:

```
if None:
    print('The condition evaluted to True')
else:
    print('The condition evaluted to False')
```

```
The condition evaluted to False
```

**Nested conditional statements**

The code inside an `if` block can also include an `if` statement inside it. This pattern is called `nesting` and is used to check for another condition after a particular condition holds true.

In \[25]:

```
a_number = 15
```

In \[26]:

```
if a_number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{a_number} is even")
    if a_number % 3 == 0:
        print(f"{a_number} is also divisible by 3")
    else:
        print(f"{a_number} is not divisibule by 3")
else:
    print(f"{a_number} is odd".format(a_number))
    if a_number % 5 == 0:
        print(f"{a_number} is also divisible by 5")
    else:
        print(f"{a_number} is not divisibule by 5")
```

```
15 is odd
15 is also divisible by 5
```

Notice how the `print` statements are indented by 8 spaces to indicate that they are part of the inner `if`/`else` blocks.

> Nested `if`, `else` statements are often confusing to read and prone to human error. It's good to avoid nesting whenever possible, or limit the nesting to 1 or 2 levels.

**Shorthand `if` conditional expression**

A frequent use case of the `if` statement involves testing a condition and setting a variable's value based on the condition.

```
a_number = 13

if a_number % 2 == 0:
    parity = 'even'
else:
    parity = 'odd'

print(f'The number {a_number} is {parit}.')
```

```
The number 13 is odd.
```

Python provides a shorter syntax, which allows writing such conditions in a single line of code. It is known as a _conditional expression_, sometimes also referred to as a _ternary operator_. It has the following syntax:

```
x = true_value if condition else false_value
```

It has the same behavior as the following `if`-`else` block:

```
if condition:
    x = true_value
else:
    x = false_value
```

Let's try it out for the example above.

In \[28]:

```
parity = 'even' if a_number % 2 == 0 else 'odd'
```

In \[29]:

```
print('The number {a_number} is {parity}.')
```

```
The number 13 is odd.
```

**Statements and Expressions**

The conditional expression highlights an essential distinction between _statements_ and _expressions_ in Python.

> **Statements**: A statement is an instruction that can be executed. Every line of code we have written so far is a statement e.g. assigning a variable, calling a function, conditional statements using `if`, `else`, and `elif`, loops using `for` and `while` etc.
>
> **Expressions**: An expression is some code that evaluates to a value. Examples include values of different data types, arithmetic expressions, conditions, variables, function calls, conditional expressions, etc.

Most expressions can be executed as statements, but not all statements are expressions. For example, the regular `if` statement is not an expression since it does not evaluate to a value. It merely performs some branching in the code. Similarly, loops and function definitions are not expressions (we'll learn more about these in later sections).

As a rule of thumb, an expression is anything that can appear on the right side of the assignment operator `=`. You can use this as a test for checking whether something is an expression or not. You'll get a syntax error if you try to assign something that is not an expression.

In \[30]:

```
# if statement
result = if a_number % 2 == 0: 
    'even'
else:
    'odd'
```

```
 File "<ipython-input-30-f24978c5423e>", line 2
    result = if a_number % 2 == 0:
             ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

In \[31]:

```
# if expression
result = 'even' if a_number % 2 == 0 else 'odd'
```

**The `pass` statement**

`if` statements cannot be empty, there must be at least one statement in every `if` and `elif` block. You can use the `pass` statement to do nothing and avoid getting an error.

```
a_number = 9
```

In \[33]:

```
if a_number % 2 == 0:
elif a_number % 3 == 0:
    print(f'{a_number} is divisible by 3 but not divisible by 2')
```

```
  File "<ipython-input-33-77268dd66617>", line 2
    elif a_number % 3 == 0:
    ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block
```

In \[34]:

```
if a_number % 2 == 0:
    pass
elif a_number % 3 == 0:
    print(f'{a_number} is divisible by 3 but not divisible by 2')
```

```
9 is divisible by 3 but not divisible by 2
```

#### Iteration with `while` loops

Another powerful feature of programming languages, closely related to branching, is running one or more statements multiple times. This feature is often referred to as _iteration_ on _looping_, and there are two ways to do this in Python: using `while` loops and `for` loops.

`while` loops have the following syntax:

```
while condition:
    statement(s)
```

Statements in the code block under `while` are executed repeatedly as long as the `condition` evaluates to `True`. Generally, one of the statements under `while` makes some change to a variable that causes the condition to evaluate to `False` after a certain number of iterations.

Let's try to calculate the factorial of `100` using a `while` loop. The factorial of a number `n` is the product (multiplication) of all the numbers from `1` to `n`, i.e., `1*2*3*...*(n-2)*(n-1)*n`.

In \[38]:

```
result = 1
i = 1

while i <= 100:
    result = result * i
    i = i+1

print(f'The factorial of 100 is: {result}')
```

```
The factorial of 100 is: 93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000
```

Here's how the above code works:

* We initialize two variables, `result` and, `i`. `result` will contain the final outcome. And `i` is used to keep track of the next number to be multiplied with `result`. Both are initialized to 1 (can you explain why?)
* The condition `i <= 100` holds true (since `i` is initially `1`), so the `while` block is executed.
* The `result` is updated to `result * i`, `i` is increased by `1` and it now has the value `2`.
* At this point, the condition `i <= 100` is evaluated again. Since it continues to hold true, `result` is again updated to `result * i`, and `i` is increased to `3`.
* This process is repeated till the condition becomes false, which happens when `i` holds the value `101`. Once the condition evaluates to `False`, the execution of the loop ends, and the `print` statement below it is executed.

Can you see why `result` contains the value of the factorial of 100 at the end? If not, try adding `print` statements inside the `while` block to print `result` and `i` in each iteration.

> Iteration is a powerful technique because it gives computers a massive advantage over human beings in performing thousands or even millions of repetitive operations really fast. With just 4-5 lines of code, we were able to multiply 100 numbers almost instantly. The same code can be used to multiply a thousand numbers (just change the condition to `i <= 1000`) in a few seconds.

You can check how long a cell takes to execute by adding the _magic_ command `%%time` at the top of a cell. Try checking how long it takes to compute the factorial of `100`, `1000`, `10000`, `100000`, etc.

Here's another example that uses two `while` loops to create an interesting pattern.

**Infinite Loops**

Suppose the condition in a `while` loop always holds true. In that case, Python repeatedly executes the code within the loop forever, and the execution of the code never completes. This situation is called an infinite loop. It generally indicates that you've made a mistake in your code. For example, you may have provided the wrong condition or forgotten to update a variable within the loop, eventually falsifying the condition.

If your code is _stuck_ in an infinite loop during execution, just press the "Stop" button on the toolbar (next to "Run") or select "Kernel > Interrupt" from the menu bar. This will _interrupt_ the execution of the code. The following two cells both lead to infinite loops and need to be interrupted.

```
# INFINITE LOOP - INTERRUPT THIS CELL

result = 1
i = 1

while i <= 100:
    result = result * i
    # forgot to increment i
```

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyboardInterrupt                         Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-41-5234d8c241fc> in <module>
      5 
      6 while i <= 100:
----> 7     result = result * i
      8     # forgot to increment i

KeyboardInterrupt: 
```

In \[42]:

```
# INFINITE LOOP - INTERRUPT THIS CELL

result = 1
i = 1

while i > 0 : # wrong condition
    result *= i
    i += 1
```

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

      6 while i > 0 : # wrong condition

      8     i += 1

**`break` and `continue` statements**

You can use the `break` statement within the loop's body to immediately stop the execution and _break_ out of the loop (even if the condition provided to `while` still holds true).

In \[43]:

```
i = 1
result = 1

while i <= 100:
    result *= i
    if i == 42:
        print('Magic number 42 reached! Stopping execution..')
        break
    i += 1
    
print('i:', i)
print('result:', result)
```

```
Magic number 42 reached! Stopping execution..
i: 42
result: 1405006117752879898543142606244511569936384000000000
```

As you can see above, the value of `i` at the end of execution is 42. This example also shows how you can use an `if` statement within a `while` loop.

Sometimes you may not want to end the loop entirely, but simply skip the remaining statements in the loop and _continue_ to the next loop. You can do this using the `continue` statement.

```
i = 1
result = 1

while i < 20:
    i += 1
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(f'Skipping {i}')
        continue
    print(f'Multiplying with {i}')
    result = result * i
    
print('i:', i)
print('result:', result)
```

```
Skipping 2
Multiplying with 3
Skipping 4
Multiplying with 5
Skipping 6
Multiplying with 7
Skipping 8
Multiplying with 9
Skipping 10
Multiplying with 11
Skipping 12
Multiplying with 13
Skipping 14
Multiplying with 15
Skipping 16
Multiplying with 17
Skipping 18
Multiplying with 19
Skipping 20
i: 20
result: 654729075
```

In the example above, the statement `result = result * i` inside the loop is skipped when `i` is even, as indicated by the messages printed during execution.

> **Logging**: The process of adding `print` statements at different points in the code (often within loops and conditional statements) for inspecting the values of variables at various stages of execution is called logging. As our programs get larger, they naturally become prone to human errors. Logging can help in verifying the program is working as expected. In many cases, `print` statements are added while writing & testing some code and are removed later.

#### Iteration with `for` loops

A `for` loop is used for iterating or looping over sequences, i.e., lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings, and _ranges_. For loops have the following syntax:

```
for value in sequence:
    statement(s)
```

The statements within the loop are executed once for each element in `sequence`. Here's an example that prints all the element of a list.

In \[46]:

```
days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']

for day in days:
    print(day)
```

```
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
```

Let's try using `for` loops with some other data types.

```
# Looping over a string
for char in 'Monday':
    print(char)
```

```
M
o
n
d
a
y
```

In \[48]:

```
# Looping over a tuple
for fruit in ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Guava']:
    print("Here's a fruit:", fruit)
```

```
Here's a fruit: Apple
Here's a fruit: Banana
Here's a fruit: Guava
```

In \[49]:

```
# Looping over a dictionary
person = {
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'sex': 'Male',
    'age': 32,
    'married': True
}

for key in person:
    print("Key:", key, ",", "Value:", person[key])
```

```
Key: name , Value: John Doe
Key: sex , Value: Male
Key: age , Value: 32
Key: married , Value: True
```

Note that while using a dictionary with a `for` loop, the iteration happens over the dictionary's keys. The key can be used within the loop to access the value. You can also iterate directly over the values using the `.values` method or over key-value pairs using the `.items` method.

In \[50]:

```
for value in person.values():
    print(value)
```

```
John Doe
Male
32
True
```

In \[51]:

```
for key_value_pair in person.items():
    print(key_value_pair)
```

```
('name', 'John Doe')
('sex', 'Male')
('age', 32)
('married', True)
```

Since a key-value pair is a tuple, we can also extract the key & value into separate variables.

```
for key, value in person.items():
    print("Key:", key, ",", "Value:", value)
```

```
Key: name , Value: John Doe
Key: sex , Value: Male
Key: age , Value: 32
Key: married , Value: True
```

**Iterating using `range` and `enumerate`**

The `range` function is used to create a sequence of numbers that can be iterated over using a `for` loop. It can be used in 3 ways:

* `range(n)` - Creates a sequence of numbers from `0` to `n-1`
* `range(a, b)` - Creates a sequence of numbers from `a` to `b-1`
* `range(a, b, step)` - Creates a sequence of numbers from `a` to `b-1` with increments of `step`

Let's try it out.

In \[53]:

```
for i in range(7):
    print(i)
```

```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
```

In \[54]:

```
for i in range(3, 10):
    print(i)
```

```
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

In \[55]:

```
for i in range(3, 14, 4):
    print(i)
```

```
3
7
11
```

**`break`, `continue` and `pass` statements**

Similar to `while` loops, `for` loops also support the `break` and `continue` statements. `break` is used for breaking out of the loop and `continue` is used for skipping ahead to the next iteration.

In \[58]:

```
weekdays = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']
```

In \[59]:

```
for day in weekdays:
    print('Today is {}'.format(day))
    if (day == 'Wednesday'):
        print("I don't work beyond Wednesday!")
        break
```

```
Today is Monday
Today is Tuesday
Today is Wednesday
I don't work beyond Wednesday!
```

In \[60]:

```
for day in weekdays:
    if (day == 'Wednesday'):
        print("I don't work on Wednesday!")
        continue
    print('Today is {}'.format(day))
```

```
Today is Monday
Today is Tuesday
I don't work on Wednesday!
Today is Thursday
Today is Friday
```

Like `if` statements, `for` loops cannot be empty, so you can use a `pass` statement if you don't want to execute any statements inside the loop.

In \[61]:

```
for day in weekdays:
    pass
```

**Nested `for` and `while` loops**

Similar to conditional statements, loops can be nested inside other loops. This is useful for looping lists of lists, dictionaries etc.

In \[62]:

```
persons = [{'name': 'John', 'sex': 'Male'}, {'name': 'Jane', 'sex': 'Female'}]

for person in persons:
    for key in person:
        print(key, ":", person[key])
    print(" ")
```

```
name : John
sex : Male
 
name : Jane
sex : Female
```

```
days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'guava']

for day in days:
    for fruit in fruits:
        print(day, fruit)
```

```
Monday apple
Monday banana
Monday guava
Tuesday apple
Tuesday banana
Tuesday guava
Wednesday apple
Wednesday banana
Wednesday guava
```

With this, we conclude our discussion of branching and loops in Python.
