Before starting with anything, let's start the learning from the very first question that comes in our mind, which is&#x20;

<h3 align="center">What is Programming?</h3>

Suppose I am your teacher and \
I ask what 5+7 is, and you will answer 12\
Then he asks what 15\*3 is,                                                                                              and you will answer 45\
So this scenario is between 2 human beings, and we call it a conversation or a discussion\
\
where your teacher is giving you some instructions, and you accept, understand, and follow them.&#x20;

If such instructions are given to a computer and it follows your instructions, we can call this scenario as programming.

**Definition: A** Set of Instructions given to a computer is called Programming.&#x20;
