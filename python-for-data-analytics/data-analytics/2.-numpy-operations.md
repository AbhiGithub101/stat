# 2. Numpy operations

There are a few NumPy operations that you should know. Below are basic mathematical operations with examples.

```python
import numpy as np
```

sum()\
sum function adds all the values in an array.

```python
score = [100, 300, 500, 200]
arr = np.array(score)
np.sum(arr)
```

Output:

```python
np.int64(1100)
```

max()\
max function finds the highest value.

```python
np.max(arr)
```

Output:

```python
np.int64(500)
```

min()\
min function finds the lowest value.

```python
np.min(arr)
```

Output:

```python
np.int64(100)
```

mean\
mean is also called average (arithmetical average).

```python
np.mean(arr)
```

Output:

```python
np.float64(275.0)
```

### üîπ **MEAN (Average)**

#### **Definition:**

The **mean** is the _sum of all values divided by the total number of values_.\
It represents the **central tendency** if data is fairly balanced (no extreme outliers).

#### **Formula:**

$$
mean = sum  of all values / number  of values
$$

#### **Example 1:**

Suppose your monthly expenses for 5 months are:

```
[20,000, 22,000, 21,000, 23,000, 24,000]
```

**Mean = (20,000 + 22,000 + 21,000 + 23,000 + 24,000) / 5 = 110,000 / 5 = 22,000**

So, your **average monthly expense** = ‚Çπ22,000.

#### **When to use mean:**

* Data is **symmetrical** (no big outliers).
* You want a **true numerical average**.\
  Example: average marks, temperature, or salary in a _homogeneous group_.

#### **Problem with mean:**

It gets **distorted by outliers**.

**Example 2:**

Salaries (in ‚Çπ):

```
[30,000, 32,000, 35,000, 40,000, 5,00,000]
```

Mean = (30,000 + 32,000 + 35,000 + 40,000 + 5,00,000) / 5\
\= 6,37,000 / 5 = **‚Çπ1,27,400**

That looks like everyone earns ‚Çπ1.27L on average ‚Äî **completely misleading**, because one person (5L) skewed it.

***

### üîπ **MEDIAN (Middle Value)**

#### **Definition:**

The **median** is the _middle value when data is sorted_.\
It‚Äôs the value that splits data into two equal halves ‚Äî half below it, half above it.

#### **Steps:**

1. Arrange data in ascending order.
2. If odd number of values ‚Üí middle one is the median.
3. If even number ‚Üí average of two middle values.

#### **Example 1:**

Expenses: `[20,000, 21,000, 22,000, 23,000, 24,000]`\
‚Üí Middle value = **22,000** ‚Üí **Median = ‚Çπ22,000**

Same as mean here, because data is symmetric.

#### **Example 2 (Skewed data):**

Salaries: `[30,000, 32,000, 35,000, 40,000, 5,00,000]`\
‚Üí Sorted: already sorted\
‚Üí Middle value = **35,000**

So **Median = ‚Çπ35,000**

Now, that‚Äôs much more representative of what most people earn.\
The **median resists outliers**, while the mean doesn‚Äôt.

### üîπ **Quick Summary:**

| Concept    | Formula / Definition          | Sensitive to Outliers? | Example Use                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Mean**   | (Sum of all values) √∑ (Count) | ‚úÖ Yes                  | Average marks, temperatures |
| **Median** | Middle value after sorting    | ‚ùå No                   | Income, house prices        |

***

#### ‚öñÔ∏è When to use which:

* **Use Mean** ‚Üí Data is _balanced_ and _no outliers_ (like exam marks).
* **Use Median** ‚Üí Data is _skewed_ or _has outliers_ (like salaries, property prices).
