This is a huge file with 12 million rows of alcohol sales records. It is a good file to show population and sample.&#x20;

For the sake of teaching you about population and sample. Let us consider the whole alcohol record as a population.

Imagine a beer company has sold 12 million beer in a year. Let's load the whole data.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('Iowa_Liquor_Sales.csv)
df
```

When you will be loading this data , You will realize how long it took just to load. Now imagine how long it will take to  perform operations on this data. &#x20;

### Find Top 5 Store with highest number of sales

if you will perform operation on this whole data , it will take a long time. If you want to find Top 5 Stores with highest number of sales, You can use sample size to perform analysis on it. Let's take Sample size of 5%.

**Sample Size** : 5%

```
df = df.sample(frac=0.05)
df
```

We are going to use this data as our sample. It has given us random 5% of data.&#x20;

Now let's find Top 5 Store with highest Number of Sales.

```python
df['Store Name'].value_counts().head()
```

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

With the help of sample  , These are the top 5 stores. You can even increase sample size by 10% or 15% and check results. Most probably Store Name will be same. Try it on your own.

By working on this sample, We can make a judgement about our Top 5 Stores.
