# 3. Population and Sample

> There are 145 crores people in india. There are 149 crore dreams.&#x20;



To begin with statistics , you must understand the concept of population and sample. Let us understand the concept of population and sample by the same wake fit example.

> According to Wake fit’s _Great Indian Sleep Scorecard 2023_, **87% of Indians use their phones just before bedtime**. Among those aged 25–34, **78% stay up late browsing social media**.

Take a moment and understand this statement. Are you an Indian ? if yes , were you ever contacted by the wake fit team for this survey ?&#x20;

If you were not contacted by them , don't you think this survey is wrong , because many of us were not participants in the wake fit's Great Indian sleep scorecard Survey.

This survey would be right only if everyone participated in the survey but many got left. So this survey might be wrong ? Right ?  - No.

It is nearly impossible to ask 145 crores if they use phone late-night ? The time , cost and resources we will have to spend on this survey is not worth the candle.

This is where Population and Sample Comes. Population is the whole data. It is the ideal data we should perform survey on. While Sample is the small data that represents the whole population and performing analysis on Sample is relatively easy.

### **Population**

**Definition:**\
The population is **the entire group of people or things you are interested in studying**.

* It includes **everyone or everything** that fits the criteria.

**Examples:**

1. If you want to study **phone usage in India**, the population is **all people living in India**.
2. If you want to study **students in your school**, the population is **all students in your school**.
3. If a company wants to know the average salary of its employees, the population is **all employees of the company**.

### **Sample**

**Definition:**\
A sample is **a smaller part of the population that is selected to represent the whole population**.

* Instead of studying everyone (which is often impossible), we study a **sample** and then draw conclusions about the population.
* A good sample should be **representative** of the population.

**Examples:**

1. Survey **1,000 people** from India about phone usage — this 1,000 people are your **sample**.
2. Survey **50 students** from your school to find average marks — these 50 are your **sample**.
3. Test a medicine on **100 patients** to predict its effect on all patients — these 100 patients are your **sample**.

### Sample Size

Sample size is the size of the data we choose for sample. It is usually 5-10% of the whole population , but it may vary.
