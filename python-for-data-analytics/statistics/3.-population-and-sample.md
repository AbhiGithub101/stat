# 3. Population and Sample

> There are 145 crores people in india. There are 149 crore dreams.&#x20;



To begin with statistics , you must understand the concept of population and sample. Let us understand the concept of population and sample by the same wakefit example.

> According to Wakefit’s _Great Indian Sleep Scorecard 2023_, **87% of Indians use their phones just before bedtime**. Among those aged 25–34, **78% stay up late browsing social media**.

Take a moment and understand this statement. Are you an indian ? if yes , were you ever contacted by the wakefit team for this survey ?&#x20;

If you were not contacted by them , don't you think this survey is wrong , because many of us were not participants in the wakefit's Great indian sleep scorecard Survey.

This survey would be right only if every one participated in the survey but many got left. So this survey might be wrong ? Right ?  - No.

It is nearly impossible to ask 145 crores if they use phone latenight ? The time , cost and resources we will have to spend on this survey is not worth the candle.

This is where Population and Sample Comes. Population is the whole data. It is the ideal data we should perform survey on. While Sample is the small data that represents the whole population and performing analysis on Sample is relatively easy.
