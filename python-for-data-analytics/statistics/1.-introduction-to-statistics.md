I bet you are reading this on your phone while lying in bed. You are not alone.

According to Wakefit‚Äôs _Great Indian Sleep Scorecard 2023_, **87% of Indians use their phones just before bedtime**. Among those aged 25‚Äì34, **78% stay up late browsing social media**.

This is an example of **statistics in action**.

### What is Statistics ?&#x20;

_<mark style="color:purple;">**Statistics is the science (not math) of collecting , organizing , analyzing and interpreting the data.**</mark>_

### Let's Understand the definition by an example :&#x20;

#### üìò Example ‚Äî _Smartphone Usage Before Bedtime_

Let‚Äôs say you want to know:

> ‚ÄúDo most people in India use their phones before going to sleep?‚Äù

You can‚Äôt ask every person in the country, so you follow the **process of statistics** step by step:

***

#### 1. **Collecting the Data**

You create an online survey and collect responses from **10,000 people** across India.\
Each person answers questions like:

* ‚ÄúDo you use your phone before sleeping?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúFor how long?‚Äù

***

#### 2. **Organizing the Data**

You put all the responses in a **table or spreadsheet**.\
Example columns:

| Person | Age | Gender | Uses phone before bed? | Time spent (mins) |
| ------ | --- | ------ | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1      | 26  | Male   | Yes                    | 45                |
| 2      | 30  | Female | Yes                    | 30                |
| 3      | 19  | Male   | No                     | 0                 |

You now have **structured data** that can be analyzed.

***

#### 3. **Analyzing the Data**

You summarize the information:

* 8,700 out of 10,000 people said **Yes** ‚Üí **87%** use their phone before bed.
* Average time spent = **42 minutes**.
* Among 25‚Äì34 age group ‚Üí **78%** scroll social media late at night.

That‚Äôs your **analysis** ‚Äî the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù of your data.

***

#### 4. **Interpreting the Data**

Now you make sense of it ‚Äî the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù or ‚Äúso what.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúA large majority of young adults in India are using their phones before sleeping, which could be affecting their sleep quality.‚Äù

This is where you **turn numbers into meaning** ‚Äî the heart of statistics.
