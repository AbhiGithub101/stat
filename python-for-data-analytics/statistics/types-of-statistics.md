# Types of Statistics

> **“It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.”** — Sherlock Holmes

Statistics can be divided into two parts. Most of the statistics fall into these two kinds.

1. Descriptive Statistics
2. Inferential Statistics

### Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive Statistics is to **summarize** the data you have. It is used to show **patterns , trend , average**s but **it does not make any conclusions** , just **straight facts**.

for an example , when you have collected responses of 10000 people for your Wakefit sleep project and analyzed the data you came up with these stats :&#x20;

* A survey of 10,000 people shows that **87% use phones before bedtime**.
* Average daily time spent on social media = 4.5 hours.
* Among 25–34 age group → **78%** scroll social media late at night.

> This is descriptive statistics. You tell what is in the data already , but hidden. Basically you summarize the whole data.

### Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics **uses a sample of data to make conclusions or predictions about a larger population**.

for an example :&#x20;

> **87% of Indians use their phones just before bedtime**. Among those aged 25–34, **78% stay up late browsing social media**.

| Feature | Descriptive Statistics                       | Inferential Statistics                            |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose | Summarize data                               | Make conclusions or predictions                   |
| Scope   | Only the data collected                      | Entire population (beyond sample)                 |
| Example | 87% of surveyed people use phones before bed | Estimate 87% of all Indians use phones before bed |
